# My Research
- According to the article I read, a lot of college students have academic goals that deal with them wanting to learn something new things and acquiring new skills (mastery-approach goals), not wanting to lose already acquired skills and knowledge (mastery-avoidance goals (performance-approach goals), and avoiding failing to outperform others (performance-avoidance goals). Like the article, my recreational goals also require me to acquire new skills and learn new things. 
- In the article, it stated only achievements that students required regarding academics, but a lot of my personal goals did not have any relation to academics except for my desire to get a masters degree in my professional goal. 
- Overall, just like most of the students surveyed in the article, I require to succeed and acquire new skills that will help me succeed.
